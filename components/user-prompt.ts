export const aboutMe = `My name is Aziz. I’m an experienced full-stack web developer from Chitral, a northern region of KPK province in Pakistan. I completed my schooling in BUNI, the main hub of Chitral district, then moved to Chitral city for my intermediate studies in general science. I later pursued my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Fast University, Islamabad, graduating in 2021.

Professionally, I have over 2.5 years of hands-on experience in web development. I began my career working remotely with a Maldives-based company, Capilin Pvt Ltd, as a React and WordPress Developer. I built custom WordPress themes and plugins, and worked with technologies like React.js, TailwindCSS, and MUI. Currently, I’m based in Lahore and working as a Full Stack Web Engineer at Swati Technologies.

My technical expertise spans both frontend and backend. On the frontend, I’m proficient in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, TailwindCSS, ShadCN, MUI, and Ant Design. On the backend, I work with PHP, Node.js, and Express.js. For databases, I’ve worked with SQL, MongoDB, and Supabase. I'm also experienced with WordPress, WooCommerce, and Elementor.

Some of my projects include developing full-stack applications using React, Next.js, and Node.js, along with building client websites and portfolio projects. I’m currently using tools like React Query, Next.js, and Express.js in my day-to-day work.

Outside of tech, I enjoy playing soccer and mobile games. I’m passionate about full-stack development, optimizing applications, and exploring new technologies. In the future, I aim to deepen my expertise in cloud computing and AI. I believe in building clean, efficient, and user-focused digital experiences.`;
