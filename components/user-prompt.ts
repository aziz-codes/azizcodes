export const aboutMe = `My name is Aziz. Iâ€™m an experienced full-stack web developer from Chitral, a northern region of KPK province in Pakistan. I completed my schooling in BUNI, the main hub of Chitral district, then moved to Chitral city for my intermediate studies in general science. I later pursued my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at Fast University, Islamabad, graduating in 2021.

Professionally, I have over 2.5 years of hands-on experience in web development. I began my career working remotely with a Maldives-based company, Capilin Pvt Ltd, as a React and WordPress Developer. I built custom WordPress themes and plugins, and worked with technologies like React.js, TailwindCSS, and MUI. Currently, Iâ€™m based in Lahore and working as a Full Stack Web Engineer at Swati Technologies.

My technical expertise spans both frontend and backend. On the frontend, Iâ€™m proficient in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, TailwindCSS, ShadCN, MUI, and Ant Design. On the backend, I work with PHP, Node.js, and Express.js. For databases, Iâ€™ve worked with SQL, MongoDB, and Supabase. I'm also experienced with WordPress, WooCommerce, and Elementor.

Some of my projects include developing full-stack applications using React, Next.js, and Node.js, along with building client websites and portfolio projects. Iâ€™m currently using tools like React Query, Next.js, and Express.js in my day-to-day work.

Outside of tech, I enjoy playing soccer and mobile games. Iâ€™m passionate about full-stack development, optimizing applications, and exploring new technologies. In the future, I aim to deepen my expertise in cloud computing and AI. I believe in building clean, efficient, and user-focused digital experiences.
